I recently visited Cape Ann Animal Aid and fell in love with a dog named Andy. Unfortunately, he isn't ready for adoption yet because he still needs to be neutered. Once he's ready, they'll post his availability on their website, and the adoption process will be on a first-come, first-serve basis. To maximize my chances of adopting Andy, I've written a Python script that checks the website every 5 seconds for updates about him. I hope this strategy works for us!
